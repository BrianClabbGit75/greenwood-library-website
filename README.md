## Capstone Project-Enhancing a Community Library Website

**Project**

In this project I will be enhancing a library website called Greenwood Community Library. The website aims to be more engaging & Informative for its visitors. 

Step 1: Development On Local Workstation
Tasks 1: Implement Version Control with Git

1.1. Initialize Git Repository: Create the project directory or folder and name it "MarketPeak_Ecommerce". then cd into the new project directory and ini it as a git repository.

Note: In carrying out the this project, I have the option of using command line terminal of choice, but because I am using windows work station, I will be using "gitbash", this will allow me to run some shell commands on Windows.
